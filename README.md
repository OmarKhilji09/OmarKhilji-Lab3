This repository has a file named "exams.csv". The file includes test scores of students and other information and it can be accessed through the following link: http://roycekimmons.com/system/generate_data.php?dataset=exams&n=100. We will be going through the file and printing out students with their gender, level of education, and only  whose scores are 65+ in MATH. 

To run this file, simply type in make in the correct repository.
